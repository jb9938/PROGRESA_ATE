The PROGRESA program, a conditional cash transfer program initiated by the Mexican
government in 1997, provided cash transfers to poor households in rural areas. The
transfer was paid to mothers contingent on their children’s primary and secondary school
attendance and family visits to health services. The education component of PROGRESA
consists of providing subsidies, ranging from $70 to $255 pesos per month (depending on
the child’s gender and grade level), to children attending school in grades three to nine of
primary and lower secondary school. The program was means-tested, in that households
under a certain income poverty line were deemed eligible for the program and others with
incomes above the line were classified as ineligible, within each village. Overall, the
program transfers were important, representing 10 percent of the average expenditures of
beneficiary families in the sample.

This repository will demonstrate the use of propensity score matching method to estimate the Average Treatment effect.
